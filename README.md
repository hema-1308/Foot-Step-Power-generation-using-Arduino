**Arduino-Based Footstep Power Generation System**

---> Project Overview

This project demonstrates a sustainable energy solution that **harvests kinetic energy generated by human footsteps** and converts it into electrical energy using an Arduino microcontroller. The harvested energy is regulated, stored, and can be used to power small devices, aiming to reduce dependency on conventional power sources and promote renewable energy use.

---> Features
- Harnesses energy from footsteps using piezoelectric sensors and/or an electromagnetic generator.
- Real-time monitoring of generated voltage via Arduino.
- Load management with activation based on stored energy level.
- Energy storage using rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors.
- Interactive user interface with LCD display and LEDs.
- Data logging and debugging facilitated through Serial Monitor.
- Scalable and modular design for various high-traffic environments.

----> How It Works
1. **Energy Harvesting**: Mechanical energy from footsteps is converted into electrical energy using sensors.
2. **Signal Processing**: The Arduino reads analog voltage from sensors.
3. **Voltage Regulation**: Ensures a stable output for safe charging and device operation.
4. **Energy Storage**: Excess energy is stored in batteries or capacitors.
5. **Load Control**: Devices like LEDs are powered based on available harvested energy.
6. **User Feedback**: Voltage values are displayed on an LCD and transmitted to the Serial Monitor for live monitoring.
